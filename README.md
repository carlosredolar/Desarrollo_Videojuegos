# Sprites and backgrounds
All the art used was made by various artists contributing to Game Art 2D. We sincerely thank the fact of being able to use their art to make our project.

## Innovation

- The player can double jump.
- The cam has a collider at the left and it moves forward, so you have to rush the level.
- Colliders are made of objectgroups instead of tiles.
