## Credits

# Sprites and backgrounds
All the art used was made by various artists contributing to Game Art 2D. We sincerely thank the fact of being able to use their art to make our project.

## Innovation

- The player can double jump.
- The player can slide, so he could pass through narrow sites.
- The cam has a collider at the left and it moves forward, so you have to rush the level.
- When enemy bat dies we can see it falling dead leaving the map.
- Colliders are made of objectgroups instead of tiles.
- Trees are checkpoints, if you die after a checkpoint you will restart the level at that position.
